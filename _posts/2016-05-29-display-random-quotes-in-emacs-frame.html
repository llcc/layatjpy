<p>
The variable <code>frame-title-format</code> can be customized to show various stuffs. Today, I will give a short tutorial to let Emacs frame show random quotes each time emacs is launched.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Let's define a list called <code>quotes</code> which stores the quotes at first. I just grabbed those quotes from an emacs package <a href="https://github.com/thisirs/scratch-message">thisirs/scratch-message</a>.

  "Some quotes taken from https://litemind.com/best-famous-quotes/")
{% endhighlight %}</li>

<li><p>
Next we should take one quote each time to display it. The variable can be customized as followed:
</p>

{% highlight cl %}
(setq frame-title-format
   (nth (random (length quotes)) quotes))
{% endhighlight %}</li>
</ol>


<p>
Paste the above code into your init file, and you will see the effect next time you launch your emacs.
Any improvement and advice are appreciated.
