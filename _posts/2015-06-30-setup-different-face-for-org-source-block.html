<p>
Sometimes when your org files is jammed with org-babel blocks, it may be difficult to distinguish normal text and blocks. For this situation, setting different face is a good idea. Below cold can implement this kind of functions.

{% highlight c1 %}
(setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
(defface org-block-begin-line
  '((t (:underline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF")))
  "Face used for the line delimiting the begin of source blocks.")
(defface org-block-background
  '((t (:background "#FFFFEA"))) "Face used for the source block background.")
(defface org-block-end-line
  '((t (:overline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF")))
  "Face used for the line delimiting the end of source blocks.")
{% endhighlight %}
