I am using org-mode to typeset my manuscript and reports for almost one year. Because all my writings always contains many figures, determining the width of exported figures seems like a must-do work for me.
</p>

<p>
Org-mode support three ways to determine the figure width:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Define it in <code>org-latex-image-actual-width</code> globally. Assign a LaTeX like value <code>0.7\\textwidth</code> to it to make all the figures exported as the corresponding width.
</li>

<li>The variable can also be setup specifically for files. Add <code>#bind: org-latex-image-actual-width 0.7\\textwidth</code> to any position of your file. It can make all the figures in this file exported by this width.
</li>

<li>Add <code>#+latex_attr: 0.7\\textwidth</code> above any figure, this figure will be exported by this width.
</li>
</ol>
